# Cloud Platform Architecture Standards

This repository contains enterprise-grade cloud governance standards designed to ensure consistency, scalability, automation compatibility, and operational excellence across cloud environments.

These standards reflect real-world platform engineering practices used in production environments and include:

- Naming conventions
- Tagging standards
- Resource taxonomy
- Environment isolation architecture
- Security platform naming models

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my approach to designing governed, enterprise-ready cloud platforms — not just deploying infrastructure.
